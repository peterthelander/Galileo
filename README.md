Stock Market Predictor with built-in automatic download of data

A later version of the stock market predictor, with the added mechanism so it can download updates of new data from yahoo finance, instead of requiring large files of historical data.

For both this project and the other Stock Predictor, these were written quite a few years ago. When I look back on it now, I cringe because there is very little in the way of object oriented design / single responsibility / good coding structure. Rather, they are just a bunch of methods all in one class. Still, it was enough at the time to test out the stratagies and learn a lot while doing it!
